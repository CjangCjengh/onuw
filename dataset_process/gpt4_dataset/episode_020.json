Player2 claimed to be the Insomniac and unchanged, while Player5 also claimed to be the unchanged Insomniac; one might be lying. Player3 suspects me (Player1) to be the Troublemaker, but as the Seer, I know this isn't true. Player4 claims to be a Villager. Given no Troublemaker has come forward, it's likely there wasn't a swap, or they're staying silent, which makes it hard to determine the Robber's action. If no one disputes my claim and if Player2 or Player5 is the other Insomniac from the role pool I didn't see, then they would know if they've been swapped or not. However, if a Troublemaker was in play and I didn't see their card in the role pool, they could've swapped Player2 and Player5, making their claims accurate pre-swap.\n\nMy concise result: Player1 (myself) is the Seer, Player2 and Player5's claims of being the Insomniac are uncertain, one may be a Werewolf, Player3 and Player4's roles are unknown \u2013 possibly a Villager and a Robber or Troublemaker.",
