Player3 first claimed to be Seer but then claimed to be Robber, so it's highly likely he remains the Seer because no one debated about this role. Player1's claim to the role of Troublemaker has not been met with argument and no one else claimed to be the Troublemaker, hence he is likely the Troublemaker indeed.
