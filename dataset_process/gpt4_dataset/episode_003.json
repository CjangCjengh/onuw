If player4 knew the Robber didn't wake up, they might be the Seer. Player5's comments suggest they know something but aren't revealing much, and they might be looking for the Troublemaker to step forward, possibly because they themselves took an action. Since no Troublemaker has come forward, and player3\u2019s Robber claim is contested, it\u2019s possible the Troublemaker and Robber could be in the role pool. Player5 calling for the Troublemaker might indicate they're not the Troublemaker themselves. As for player1, they could be a Villager trying to direct the conversation productively or another special role staying under the radar. If player4 is the Seer, as suspected due to their knowledge, they could have checked the role pool or player3 and know the Robber action was false.\n  \nMy concise result: player2 (Villager or Robber if player3's claim is true), player1 (Villager or Seer if player4's not), player3 (Werewolf or Villager if bluffing), player4 (Seer), player5 (Insomniac or Troublemaker).",
