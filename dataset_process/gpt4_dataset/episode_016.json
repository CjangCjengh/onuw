Player2 claimed to have an 'odd vibes' from player4, but if player4 is truthful about being a Troublemaker and having swapped player2 and player3, the only way player2 could have an 'odd vibes' is if they are lying and are a Werewolf. Player3 claimed to be a Robber and switched with me, so if they were a Villager initially as they stated, they would be a Seer and I would be a Villager now. If player3 is lying about being a Robber to protect themselves as a Werewolf, this would mean there are two Werewolves in play and one in the role pool, which isn't possible because there are only two Werewolves in total in the game. Player4 claimed to be a Troublemaker and swapped player2 and player3, if they are truthful, they should remain as a Troublemaker. Player5 claimed to be a Villager and had no night action, so they are most likely to be a Villager unless they were swapped during the night, but no one claimed to have swapped with them. So far, the roles claimed match with the role counts and the positions, so each player is telling their truth unless one of them is playing a very deep deception game.\n\nMy concise result: I'm pretty confident that player1 (me) am a Villager now, player2 is a Villager, player3 is a Seer, player4 is a Troublemaker, and player5 is a Villager.
