Player3's request for clarification from player2 suggests they didn't perform any role-swapping action and might still be Robber if player2 was truthful. Player4's claim to have seen a Werewolf and a Villager in the role pool aligns with the Seer's action but doesn't reveal their original role. Based on the conversation, the Seer could likely be player4 if they were being honest.
